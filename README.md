## Introduction

Entropy is an Open source alternative to [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com/). It's built using; [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com/).
Although it is heavily inspired by Laravel Nova, it takes a completely new approach, giving developers much more freedom to customize
the underlying ```view```, ```create```, ```update``` and ```delete``` logic for Models.
